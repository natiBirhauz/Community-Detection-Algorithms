# Community-Detection-in-Complex-Networks

Final year project by Gavriel Shalem and Nati Birhuz, exploring advanced community detection algorithms in complex networks, aimed at uncovering and analyzing densely connected groups within networks using diffrent algorithems. This research project is a theoretical exploration that aims for a development of a practical software tool for network analysis in the future.

### Community Detection in Complex Networks

# Overview

This project is a research endeavor focused on the field of community detection within complex networks. As a pivotal aspect of network theory, community detection involves identifying groups within larger networks where nodes are more densely connected to each other than to the rest of the network. This research aims to explore various algorithms and methodologies for effectively uncovering these communities, providing insights into their underlying structures and dynamics.

# Objectives

    1.To understand the fundamental principles of complex networks and the significance of community structures within them.
    2.To evaluate and implement algorithms for community detection, assessing their efficiency, accuracy, and applicability to different types of networks.

# Team

This project is a collaborative effort between Gavriel Shalem and Nati Birhuz, we are senior students in Software Engineering at Azrieli College of Engineering. this project serves as our final year project.

# Research Scope

The research uses social networks data sets, By applying community detection algorithms to these networks, the project seeks to uncover patterns and behaviors that are universal, as well as those that are unique to specific types of networks.

# Methodology

The project beginning with a review of existing literature on community detection. Following this, various algorithms will be implemented and tested on real-world networks to evaluate their performance
